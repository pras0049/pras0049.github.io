            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Sharon Rose. I'm an Indian, I moved to Canada Two years ago. About Canada I love it 
                but I still miss my family. Things about me, I'm a nail techcian, plus I'm a creative person.. I love design and editing.
                I really wanna work at Seattle, for multiple reasons. It as always been a dream studying in aboard, I'm happy and grateful that I was able to make it happen.
            </p>
            <p>
Why and what made me to move to another country. It's because things I have gone through is worst. People around me under estimate my decision, but I was very clear
about my decision, my plans, and my goals. I planned to move to another country not only to make money but even to meet new people, get to know new cultural, explore different places and foods.
To conclude, I'm really happy about my decision I made and still hoping for best in my up-coming chapters of life. And, that's all about me.
            </p>
